# SQL

**This repository is a curated list of SQL commands**

SQL, Structured Query Language, is a programming language designed to manage data stored in relational databases. SQL operates through simple, declarative statements. This keeps data accurate and secure, and it helps maintain the integrity of databases, regardless of size.


### 1.Query for Retrieving Tables
This query can be run to retrieve the list of tables present in a database where the database is “My_Schema”.

`SELECT * FROM My_Schema.Tables;`

### 2. Query for Selecting Columns from a Table
This is perhaps the most widely used SQL query. In the example below, we are extracting the “Student_ID” column or attribute from the table “STUDENT”.

`SELECT Student_ID FROM STUDENT;`
